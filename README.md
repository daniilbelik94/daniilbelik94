ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Daniel, a 29-year-old enthusiast in full-stack development based in Hamburg, Germany.
While residing in Hamburg, I'm currently enrolled in a Full Stack Developer program and simultaneously participate in online projects with GoIT, a Ukrainian programming school.

ðŸŒ± My journey in programming involves a diverse range of languages including Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS. 
I have a particular fondness for front-end development and take pleasure in crafting visually appealing and responsive web designs.

ðŸ’¼ Living in Germany, I'm keen on collaboration and always ready to engage in exciting projects.
Don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in joining forces!
